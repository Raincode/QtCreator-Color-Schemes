Alternatively, you can run the included `install_windows.bat` which does the same thing.

## Vistual Studio Dark:

## Visual Studio Dark v2:
The newer version of Visual Studio changed things up a bit. This theme tries to adapt to those changes.
It definitely seems more colorful.

For a slight variation (if you prefer), color #d8a0df rgb(216,160,223) can be used, e.g., for keywords.
Visual Studio only highlights certain control flow keywords with this color, but not all (e.g., struct, class, ...).

## Visual Studio Blue (Light):

## Visual Studio Blue (Light) v2:
Similarly to the Visual Studio Dark Theme, there are minor adjustments made in newer versions.
Variation color: #8f08c4 rgb(143,  8,196) (see Visual Studio Dark v2)

## Solarized Dark
Comes included in QtCreator, but without a matching QtCreator theme (themes/solarized-dark.creatortheme).
Recommended environment color for this theme: #0096c8 (or similar)
